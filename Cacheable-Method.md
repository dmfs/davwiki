###Description

From [RFC 7231, Section 4.2.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.3):

> Request methods can be defined as "cacheable" to indicate that
> responses to them are allowed to be stored for future reuse; for
> specific requirements see [[RFC 7234]].  In general, safe methods that
> do not depend on a current or authoritative response are defined as
> cacheable; this specification defines [[GET]], [[HEAD]], and [[POST]] as
> cacheable, although the overwhelming majority of cache
> implementations only support [[GET]] and [[HEAD]].
